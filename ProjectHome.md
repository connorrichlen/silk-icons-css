The Silk Icon Set from Mark James (http://www.famfamfam.com) converted into a single image sprite with accompanying CSS.  All credit for the icons goes to Mark James.

The additional work I did was creating the CSS and composite image files with all of the icons.

This allows you to use the Silk Icons in the same way one would use the icons found in the JQuery UI Framework with the added benefit of improving your website's performance by reducing HTTP requests for each icon.

Example:

```

<span class="silk-icon silk-icon-accept">

Unknown end tag for &lt;/span&gt;


```
